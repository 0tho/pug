h3#comments Comments

p Single line comments look the same as JavaScript comments and must be placed on their own line:

.row(data-control='interactive')
  .col-md-6
    +jade
      :jadesrc
        // just some paragraphs
        p foo
        p bar
  .col-md-6
    +html
      :htmlsrc
        <!-- just some paragraphs -->
        <p>foo</p>
        <p>bar</p>

p Jade also supports unbuffered comments, by simply adding a hyphen

.row(data-control='interactive')
  .col-md-6
    +jade
      :jadesrc
        //- will not output within markup
        p foo
        p bar
  .col-md-6
    +html
      :htmlsrc
        <p>foo</p>
        <p>bar</p>

h4#blockcomments Block Comments

p A block comment is legal as well:

.row(data-control='interactive')
  .col-md-6
    +jade
      :jadesrc
        body
          //
            As much text as you want
            can go here.
  .col-md-6
    +html
      :htmlsrc
        <body>
          <!--
          As much text as you want
          can go here.
          -->
        </body>
