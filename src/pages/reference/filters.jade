h3#filters Filters

p Filters let you use other languages within a jade template.  They take a block of plain text as an input.

.row
  .col-lg-6
    +jade
      :jadesrc
        :markdown
          # Markdown

          I often like including markdown documents.
        script
          :coffee
            console.log 'This is coffee script'
  .col-lg-6
    +html
      :htmlsrc
        <h1>Markdown</h1>
        <p>I often like including markdown documents.</p>
        <script>console.log('This is coffee script')</script>
